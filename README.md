IoT Fun with TinkerForge, Scala, Java EE, Camunda BPM and AngularJS
==

As described in my blog, http://www.techjava.de/topics/2014/01/basement-drainage-pump-control-and-iot/ I'm playing around with Internet of Things, Home Automation running a classic Java EE stack with a great BPM Engine Camunda pimped with some Scala and using AngularJS for presentations. This is the source code for these experiments.
